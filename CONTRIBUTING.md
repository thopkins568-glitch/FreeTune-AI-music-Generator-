🎨 Design Philosophy

All contributions should follow the core mission of FreeTune-AI:

Accessibility first

If a feature makes the app easier for people with disabilities, it is a priority.

Clarity over complexity

UI must be simple, predictable, and low cognitive load.

Free forever

No paywalls, no locked features, no data selling.

Inclusiveness

Users with disabilities should always feel supported, heard, and empowered.

Low friction

Features should work with minimal steps and minimal confusion.

✔ No breaking existing features
